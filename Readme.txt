JS mono_synth & libs

Installation

To install JS mono_synth et al copy the entire Tale folder to your REAPER JS
Effects folder. The exact location of this folder depends on your REAPER
installation. To navigate to the right location launch REAPER, choose "Show
REAPER resource path in explorer/finder..." from the Options menu, and then
open the Effects folder.

Alternatively you can run the install_win.cmd (Windows) or
install_osx.command (Mac OS X) scripts.

Note: This will only work if REAPER is installed for the current logged on
user. It will not work for a portable REAPER install.
